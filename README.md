# trayio_technical

## SWAGLABS demo
My weapon of choice for this task has been Cypress.
I've also added the cucumber plugin to follow a process that respects user scenarios

## Installing the demo

Prerequisites for developing JavaScript applications. You will probably already have these:

1. Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. npm (comes with Node)

Then you can get this thing running!

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into its directory on your machine (trayio_technical folder)
2. Run `npm install`)

## Running Cypress tests from the command line

Run the following:

    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run

You should see some stuff happening and two passing tests in your Terminal window.

## Running Cypress from the GUI

To open the project in the app:

    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
